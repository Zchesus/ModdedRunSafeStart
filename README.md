# ModdedRunSafeStart

This  simple PowerShell script temporarily disables your network connection, launches the game executable (bg3.exe), and then re-enables the network interface. This safeguard prevents unexpected updates from disrupting your heavily modded playthrough, a fate I fell pray to, even with updates on Steam set to " Only update this game when I launch it"  and launching the game manually or through the Mod Nanager.

Time permitting, I may refine the script and provide a compiled version.

May your Faer√ªnian adventures be filled with excitement, wonder, and, for those who relish turn-based combat like an old XCOM aficionado like myself, plenty of sweaty tactical encounters!
