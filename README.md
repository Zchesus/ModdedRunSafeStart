# ModdedRunSafeStart
This  simple PowerShell script temporarily disables your network connection, launches bg3.exe, and then re-enables the network. This safeguard ensures that an unexpected update doesn't disrupt your heavily modded playthrough.

Time permitting, I may refine the script and provide a compiled version

May your Faer√ªnian adventures be filled with excitement, wonder, and, for those who relish turn-based combat like an old XCOM aficionado like myself, plenty of sweaty tactical encounters!
